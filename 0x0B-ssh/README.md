STEP 1. HOW TO GENERATE YOUR SSH KEY Get your sandbox (UBUNTU 20.04)

cd /root

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/school

Your PASSPHRASE shoud BE: betty

ls -a

cd .ssh

vi school.pub

Copy the RSA and save on your INTRANET PROFILE

Click Save your information

Then, go back to the project and scroll down

Just before TASK 0,

Request for a new server

Make sure your server's state is RUNNING HERE IS AN EXAMPLE
Name Username IP State
160670-web-01 ubuntu 54.208.69.207 running
STEP 2. HOW TO LOGIN TO YOUR SERVER cd /root

cd .ssh

eval $('ssh-agent')

ssh-add ~/.ssh/school

PLEASE REPLACE THE IP ADDRESS BELOW WITH YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS

ssh ubuntu@54.208.69.207

NOTE: IF YOUR SERVER SAYS "PERMISSION DENIED",PLEASE DON'T FORCE THINGS THERE'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC KEY YOU PASTED ON YOUR INTRANET PROFILE

I WILL ADVICE YOU TO BE MORE CAREFULL,BUT DELETE THE .SSH DIRECTORY AND START ALL OVER AGAIN FROM STEP 1.

OR YOU WILL JUST BE GOING IN AN ENDLES CIRCLE OF "PERMISSION DENIED"

THE COMMAND BELLOW IS FOR THOSE WHOSE SERVER IS SAYING "PERMISSION DENIED"

rm -r .ssh

BUT IF YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED TO YOUR SERVER, THEN CONTINUE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS:

ls -a

cd .ssh

ls -a

sudo vim authorised_keys

Add the RSA public key from your project TASK 3 to your authorized_keys file

Save and exit

THEN CHECK YOUR CODE FOR TASK 3

STEP 3. OPEN ANOTHER SANDBOX cd alx-system_engineering-devops

mkdir 0x0B-SSH

cd 0x0B-SSH

Create a README.md file with some content in it

TASK 0.

vi 0-use_a_private_key #!/usr/bin/env bash

A Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/school ubuntu@54.209.217.190 Make it executable chmod u+x 0-use_a_private_key

TASK 1

vi 1-create_ssh_key_pair #!/usr/bin/env bash

A script that Generates an RSA key pair with 4096 bits and passphrase "betty"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -P betty -f school Make it executable chmod u+x 1-create_ssh_key_pair

TASK 2. vi 2-ssh_config

#!/usr/bin/env bash

Configure ssh client to use public key authentication and other settings
Configure ssh client to use public key authentication and other settings
Host * SendEnv LANG LC_* HashKnownHosts yes GSSAPIAuthentication yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no IdentityFile ~/.ssh/school PasswordAuthentication no Make it executable chmod u+x 2-ssh_config

TASK 3. eval $('ssh-agent')

ssh-add ~/.ssh/school

PLEASE REPLACE THE IP ADDRESS BELOW WITH YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS

ssh ubuntu@54.208.69.207

ls -a

cd .ssh

ls -a

sudo vim authorised_keys

Add the RSA public key from your project TASK 3 to your authorized_keys file

Save and exit

THEN CHECK YOUR CODE FOR TASK 3

TASK 4.

vi 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp

Puppet manifest to configure ssh client with public key authentication
file_line { 'Turn off password authentication': ensure => 'present', path => '/etc/ssh/ssh_config', line => 'PasswordAuthentication no', }

file_line { 'Declare identity file': ensure => 'present', path => '/etc/ssh/ssh_config', line => 'IdentityFile ~/.ssh/school', }

Make it executable chmod u+x 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp

CONGRATULATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE SSH PROJECT!!
